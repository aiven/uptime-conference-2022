**Code of Conduct**

Uptime Conference is a hybrid event in which everyone can participate in an inclusive, respectful, and safe manner. We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all event participants and expect all attendees, speakers, sponsors, the event team and the program committee to show respect and courtesy to the other participants.

The terms of this Code of Conduct are non-negotiable. Your registration for or attendance at our event indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its terms.

**Expected Behavior**

All event participants, whether they are attending an in-person event or a virtual event, are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior and applicable laws.

**Unacceptable Behavior**

Harassment and offensive behavior will not be tolerated in any form, whether in person or virtually, including, but not limited to, harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in the country in which the conference or program is being held. 

Harassment includes the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors. Any report of harassment at one of our events, whether in person or virtual, will be addressed immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to unacceptable behavior should notify a conference organizer or a member of the working group at once.

Speakers and sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their presentations or booths and must refrain from the use of sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or otherwise creating a sexualized environment.

Individuals who participate (or plan to participate) in the conference, whether in-person or virtually, should conduct themselves at all times in a manner that comports with both the letter and spirit of this policy prohibiting harassment and abusive behavior, whether before, during or after the event. This includes statements made in social media postings, on-line publications, text messages, and all other forms of electronic communication.

**Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**

Breaches of this Code of Conduct may result in disqualification from participating in the registered event without a refund as well as future live and virtual events.

**Talk to Us**

If you see or experience something that seems inappropriate or makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please tell us either personally or anonymously. Our team will respond to inquiries as soon as possible via [uptime@aiven.io] or anonymously via [the form](https://forms.gle/d7KuW5RaUHwsNQBw6). If you feel comfortable enough or prefer to report an issue in-person, our conference staff can be identified by Uptime Staff t-shirts.

**Pre-Event Concerns**

If you are planning to attend the upcoming event, whether in-person or virtually and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please contact us via [uptime@aiven.io]. Precautions will be taken to ensure your comfort and safety, including, but not limited to providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact.

**COVID-19 Conduct Requirements**

Attendees at in-person events must commit to strictly complying with all applicable local health regulations, as well as all venue and event health and safety requirements. The specific requirements may vary from event to event, and will be communicated prior to and during the event. 

If you witness an attendee failing to comply with any COVID-19 health and safety requirements, please report it to a member of the conference staff immediately.

Thank you for helping us make this a welcoming and friendly environment for all.
